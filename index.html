            Our comprehensive guide to CSS flexbox layout. This complete guide explains everything about flexbox, focusing on all the different possible properties for the parent element (the flex container) and the child elements (the flex items). It also includes history, demos, patterns, and a browser support chart.
        </div>  
        
        <div class="main_block">
            <div class="container_content">
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     display
                     This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     flex-direction
                     This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     flex-wrap
                     By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     flex-flow
                     This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     justify-content
                     This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.
                     flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
                     flex-end: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
                     start: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
                     end: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
                     left: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
                     right: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.
                     center: items are centered along the line
                     space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
                     space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
                     space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
                     Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN has detailed charts. The safest values are flex-start, flex-end, and center.
     
                     There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: safe and unsafe. Using safe ensures that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data loss”).
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     align-items
                     This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     align-content
                     This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     order
                     By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     flex-grow
                     This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.
                     If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, the remaining space would take up twice as much space as the others (or it will try to, at least).
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     flex-shrink
                     This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
                     Negative numbers are invalid.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     flex-basis
                     This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     flex
                     This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, it’s like 1 0.
                </div>
                <div class="content_blocks">
                     align-self
                     This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.
                     Please see the align-items explanation to understand the available values.
